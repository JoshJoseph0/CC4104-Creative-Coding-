this is my fiest pro

The project, which is at its root functions by using p5.sound library for capturing and analysing incoming audio. the main focus of the audio analysis, is around bass frequencies. The audio analysis is used to control a real-time simulation of mycelium, which grows in threads. The threads branch and grow in simulated time and space to create visually captivating projections of a material similar to a fungal nature. The central circle is also the representation of the bass energy from the audio. its size, color saturation, and its pulse in order to have a simulation of the audio interactions. These drawers add a relationship to the visuals and sound that draw the viewer in the experience. Adding to the unpredictable variability of the program, all the threads grow randomly so each run of the project would be original. All together the code represents an artful use of p5.js for the purpose of real-time audio-reactive visualizations resulting in an engaging and compelling visual stimulations. I used a lot of online resources in order to help with this project and make it a success. However, I do believe the project would look better if both audio visualizers looked more connected. I could have done this by making them the same colour.

I also used chatGPT code as a starting point.
