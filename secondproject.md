for this project, I really wanted to make things unpredictable with the planets and their orbits. I used a lot of random functions to determine their sizes, colors, and how fast they move. This makes each time you run the simulation a bit different, which was something I found pretty interesting. It gives the whole thing a more natural, dynamic feel, as the planets each have their own unique path and behavior. I wanted it to feel less predictable and more like a little evolving system on its own.
