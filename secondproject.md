For this project, it was at the primary direction to make the planets and their orbits unpredictable as possible. I used a lot of random functions to find their size, color, and how quickly to move. This makes each simulation you run a little different, which I found very interesting. Instead of the behavior appearing more predictable, a sense of autonomy came because each planet had its own unique speed and trajectory. I liked the sense of having a little evolving system of its own, rather than a set of predicted movements. All in all , I feel as if this project was a success. However, I feel like it could have been better if I added more functions such as a scrolling animation that when you scroll more planets appear You add to the programme's endless nature. 

I used code that we did in class as a starting point
