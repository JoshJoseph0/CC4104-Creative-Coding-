# this is my 3rd project
This is my project about train lines. It is called train lines

[see the project running here](/train_lines_2025_05_26_12_46_51/index.html)


for experiment three I decided to create what represents a train map with line acting as the route to the trains take and trains going across the lines in a random way such as left to right or right to left. The trains are represented as circles on the on the lines. I used serval key ideas and principals to make the project a success. Firstly, I created a function called generate random line which does 3 main things. Number one it selects a random colour for the line. It also selects a random path with four to six segments. This helps to make sure that none the lines will look the same. The creative process for this project involved exploring the capabilities of P5.js to create a dynamic and visually engaging train map simulation. The decision to use randomly generated lines added an element of unpredictability and made each simulation unique. The trains, represented by circles, were designed to move smoothly along the lines, creating a sense of continuous motion. The inclusion of the mouseClicked()` function allowed for user interaction, enabling the addition of new trains and enhancing the dynamic nature of the program. Throughout the development process, various adjustments were made to refine the visual appearance and behavior of the lines and trains, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience. The project also served as a valuable learning experience, deepening the understanding of P5.js and the principles of creative coding. Through this creative journey, the project evolved into a captivating visualization of a dynamic train network. 

 I used chatGPT as a starting point for my code
